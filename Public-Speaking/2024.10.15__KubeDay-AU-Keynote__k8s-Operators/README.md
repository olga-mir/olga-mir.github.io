# KubeDay - APAC 2024

I was honored to deliver a keynote at KubeDay 2024 in Melbourne, Australia. Interestingly, all keynotes at this event converged around one theme: meeting the high demand for fast, reliable, and compliant service onboarding into platformsâ€”typically supported by custom Kubernetes control planes powered by operators.

My talk explored why in-house operators differ fundamentally from typical application software and the unique challenges they present for reliability testing. I addressed several key difficulties in load testing operators: the cost of provisioning real resources, complex dependencies between resources, and the lack of industry-standard load testing tools for operator workloads.

I also challenged the audience to consider whether building custom operators is always the right approach, presenting alternative strategies that might better serve their platform needs in certain scenarios.
