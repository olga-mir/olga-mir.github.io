# GDG DevFest Brisbane 2025

On October 25th, I presented at GDG DevFest Brisbane 2025, discussing the essential shift in mindset required when moving from Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to Cloud Run. This session highlighted common pitfalls of applying Kubernetes patterns to Cloud Run and demonstrated how to reimagine network security for a serverless architecture, focusing on Cloud Run's native ecosystem and identity-first security model.

# Demo Video

Watch the [demo video](https://youtu.be/RUPequlH5Kg) to see the main network security mechanisms of Google Cloud Run in action. This video, originally presented at GDG DevFest Brisbane, recaps key points from the talk and demonstrates their implementation using an AI stack featuring the n8n framework and a Gemma open-source model deployed on Cloud Run.

# Source Code

The source code for the demo featured in this video is available in the [Cloud Run n8n and LLM Demo repository](https://github.com/olga-mir/experiments/tree/main/78-2025.10-cloud-run-n8n-and-llm-demo).
