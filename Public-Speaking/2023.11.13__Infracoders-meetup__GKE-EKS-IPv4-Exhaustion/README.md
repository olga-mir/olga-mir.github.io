# Infracoders Meetup 2023

I presented at the Infracoders Melbourne meetup on November 13, 2023, discussing the challenges and solutions for IPv4 address exhaustion in managed Kubernetes services, specifically GKE and EKS.

As Kubernetes clusters scale, IPv4 address exhaustion becomes a critical challenge that platform teams must address. This talk explored the different approaches GKE and EKS take to IP address management, their trade-offs, and practical strategies for mitigating IPv4 exhaustion in production environments.
